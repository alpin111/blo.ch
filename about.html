<div class="about">


I'm a copywriter based in Zurich. I write in English and German and conceptualize cross-media campaigns.
<br><br>

I majored in English Literature, Linguistics and Philosophy at the University of Zurich where I acquired a firm grasp on language, storytelling techniques and argumentative concepts. My knowledge in programming and game design gives me an edge in conceptualizing digital campaigns.
<br><br>

I'm always interested in freelance work and flexible regarding when and where. Feel free to <a href="contact">contact</a> me.
